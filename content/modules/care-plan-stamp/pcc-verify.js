// Read back what PCC ACTUALLY attached to a care plan, so the extension stops
// guessing. Everything else in the stamp path infers success from an HTTP 200 —
// but PCC answers 200 whether it attached all five goals or silently ignored
// every one, so a "success" today means only "the request didn't blow up".
//
// PCC's own care-plan detail page settles it. Each row action names its parent
// focus outright:
//
//   editNeed(genneedid, needid)
//   editGoal(goalid, stdneedid, genneedid, ...)                     ← 3rd arg
//   editIntervention(interid, stdinterid, stdneedid, genneedid, ...) ← 4th arg
//
// So one walk of the detail pages yields exact per-focus counts — no per-item
// fetches, and no guessing at row grouping by climbing DOM ancestors.
//
// Parsing is regex over the raw HTML on purpose: PCC ships loose markup (mixed
// quotes, unclosed tags) and these ids live inside javascript: hrefs and onclick
// bodies, which is text either way.
